## 1. Do Services Such As Redis and Mysql Support Cluster Mode?

### (1) Answer
No

### (2) Explain
Perhaps it will be supported in the future, but not at the moment because the use case is not very common.

## 2. Install and Start Docker/Docker-Compose

> Docker Release Notes: https://docs.docker.com/release-notes/

### (1) Install

#### a. Linux

If you find that accessing ```gitHub.com``` is slow or failed, you can try to switch a mirror source.

```bash
# 1. install docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker --mirror Aliyun

# 2. install docker-compose by using curl.
# if it's very slow, you'd better use the next solution.
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# 3. install docker-compose by using pip3
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install docker-compose

# 4. install docker-compose by using yum
# pay attention to using at least version 1.20 or higher. Using a lower version may result in a failed compose.
yum install -y docker-compose
```

#### b. Mac

```Docker Desktop``` Installation of mac is here : https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4242 (you can choose any version).

### (2) Start

Check the Docker status by running the command ```docker info```. If it is not running, you need to start Docker first.

```bash
# Check Docker Status.
sudo systemctl status docker

# Start Docker.
sudo systemctl start docker
```

## 3. Some Common Errors

### (1) failed programming external connectivity … iptables: No chain/target/match by that name”

> failed programming external connectivity … iptables: No chain/target/match by that name

```bash
service docker restart
iptables -L 
```

### (2) docker-compose failed

> Compose failed, and the prompt for the docker-compose command appeared when do compose. #5

The reason for the error is that your docker-compose version is too low. It is recommended to upgrade your docker-compose version. [Issues#5](https://github.com/WGrape/sparrow/issues/5)

```bash
# upgrade to 1.27.2
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### (3) how to find the ip of container

You should use the ```docker inspect``` command to find the ip of container.

```bash
docker inspect sparrow_container_test_go
```

### (4) mongodb authentication failed

If you've tried various methods and still encounter authentication failures, then delete your local data mount directory, for example, delete the directory ```sparrow/mongodb/data```.
