## 1. How to upload image

### (1) upload a basic image

Assuming there is a service named ```etcd``` locally, with the image name ```sparrow-basic-etcd``` and version ```3.5.0```. If you want to upload this image to Docker Hub, you need to use the following commands

```bash
./sparrowtool upload -t basic -s etcd -v 3.5.0
```

It must be noted that after upload, the version of the remote image may not be the same as the local version.

- local image version: ```3.5.0```
- remote image version: ```1.0.{{timestamp}}```

In order to prevent the remote image version from being mistakenly replaced, if you want to upload a version same to the local one, you must use the ```-r``` option, it means ```replace```, such as ```-r true```.

```bash
./sparrowtool upload -t basic -s etcd -v 3.5.0 -r true
```

This way, there will be a remote image with version ```3.5.0```.

### (2) upload a app image

The usage is the same as above, not repeated here.

```bash
./sparrowtool upload -t app -s etcd -v latest

./sparrowtool upload -t app -s etcd -v latest -r true
```

## 2. How to create new service

### (1) use sparrowtool

You can use the ```sparrowtool``` to create new service. If you want to create a ```jupyter``` service, you can use this command bellow.

```bash
# if you forget command, for help.
./sparrowtool --help

./sparrowtool new -t service -s jupyter -p 2300 -v 0.1.0
```

After a successful execution, there will be a directory named ```/jupyter``` under the project root directory.

#### ① assign a port number

If you don't know which port number to use, you add your service(such as ```langchain```) to ```subdirectories=("etcd" "etcdkeeper" ... "langchain")``` of ```search_env()``` in ```sparrowtool``` file. Then run this command bellow.

```bash
./sparrowtool env -l _port 
```

From the image below, you can see that the system has allocated a port range of ```[3300, 3400)``` to the new service langchain.

### (2) modify your service configuration

You must modify these image variables in ```./jupyter/.env``` file as bellow.

- ```IMAGE_OFFICIAL_JUPYTER_NAME```: the official image name.
- ```IMAGE_OFFICIAL_JUPYTER_VERSION```: \[optional modify\] the official image version, such as ```IMAGE_OFFICIAL_JUPYTER_VERSION=18.19.0```.
- ```IMAGE_BASIC_JUPYTER_VERSION```: \[optional modify\] the basic image version. It is recommended to set the same value as ```IMAGE_OFFICIAL_JUPYTER_VERSION```.
- ```IMAGE_APP_JUPYTER_VERSION```: \[optional modify\] the app image name. It is recommended to set ```latest```

These are must modify variables, if you have another demand, you can modify more in the ```./jupyter``` directory.

### (3) add your service to ENABLE_SERVICE_LIST in your /.work/config/.env file

The ```ENABLE_SERVICE_LIST``` variables is defined in ```/.work/config/.env.amd64``` or ```/.work/config/.env.arm64``` file, you should add ```jupyter``` the new service to the variable.

```
ENABLE_SERVICE_LIST=("xxx" "xxx" "jupyter")
```

### (4) delete /.env file

After that, you should delete ```/.env``` file in the root path of your project, because an updated ```/.env``` file can be automatically generated in a while.

### (5) start service

Now, you can enjoy the service use the following command.

```bash
./sparrow startone jupyter
```

Of course, if you need to make some custom modifications to the image, you can update the service ! Please continue to the next part: [How to update a service](#3How-to-update-a-service) doc

## 3、How to update a service

When the content of the image needs to be modified to support new requirements, the services need to be updated, which is actually updating the image.

### (1) Update a Service

```bash
./sparrow updateone {service}
```

### (2) Usage Example

When we need to adjust the Go version to ```1.17.0``` (default is 1.21.1), follow these steps:

1. First, modify the official image: change ```IMAGE_OFFICIAL_GO_VERSION=1.21.1``` in the ```/.env``` file to ```IMAGE_OFFICIAL_GO_VERSION=1.17.0```.
2. Then, modify the basic image: change ```IMAGE_BASIC_GO_VERSION=1.21.1``` in the ```/.env``` file to ```IMAGE_BASIC_GO_VERSION=1.17.0```.
3. Finally, update the go service: execute ```./sparrow updateone go```.

## 4、How nginx proxy pass server

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/WGrape/sparrow/assets/35942268/e9ce4bfc-cac7-4474-b1c8-07d17c16cfbe">

### (1) Container Config

```
GO_HOST_PORT=8002 # port number of the host that deployed the go service.
GO_CONTAINER_PORT=8001 # port number of go container

NGINX_HOST_GO_PROXY_PORT=8004 # the host port number for nginx proxying the go service.
NGINX_CONTAINER_GO_PROXY_PORT=8003 # the container port number for nginx proxying the go service.
```

### (2) Proxy Config

```conf
server {
    listen {{go_proxy_port}};

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://{go_server_addr}:{{go_server_port}};
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    error_log /var/log/nginx/nginx_error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/goproxy_access.log;
}
```

## 5、The mounting of service on the host

### (1) service directory mounting

Each service directory will be mounted to the /home/sparrow/{service} directory of the container.

### (2) data directory mounting
Each service has a ```data``` directory, which is the only data channel from the host to the container. For example

- the persistent data of databases like MySQL and Redis will be mounted to their ```data``` directories.
- projects based on environments such as Python/PHP/Go will be mounted to their ```ata``` directories.
